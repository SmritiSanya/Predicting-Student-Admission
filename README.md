# Predicting-Student-Admission

As students, we all want to know whether we will get admitted to a particular university or not, and our chances of admission are determined by a variety of elements such as our GRE score, GPA, TOEFL score, LOR, and so on. This Prediction model assists you in analysing the odds of a student being admitted to a university while taking into account all of the elements that may effect a student's acceptance. A student can submit his information and learn how likely he is to be admitted to a university.

Using the notion of supervised learning, I tried out several ML models to see which one worked the best with the highest accuracy. To measure accuracy in regression, mean squared error was utilised as a factor. The model is better if the mean squared error is near to zero. Multiple Regression was the model that proved to be effective in this scenario.
